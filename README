COMPILATION AND RUNNING: 
to compile the code: javac Run.java

to run: java Run <NUMBER OR EXAMPLES> <MAX NUMBER OF TASKS> <MAX SIZE OF QUEUE>
The code currently runs a method that was used for the Experimentation.
You can change that by selecting the method that you want
manualRun - takes input from console, outputs to console

singleRun - takes command line arguments, runs <Number of examples> examples on
a graph of size <Max number of tasks>. Outputs in results.txt

fullRun - takes command line arguments, runs <Number of examples> examples on
graphs of size from 10 to <Max number of tasks> in increments of 10. Outputs in results.txt

RESULTS FROM EXPERIMENTS:

I first ran 50 experiments on graphs of size 50,100,150...500. The results seemed to suggest
that as the number of tasks increments, the percent of solutions increaces. The results can be
seen in results1.txt

Then I ran 1000 eperiments on graphs of size 10,20,30....200. Those results were very inconclusive
and it seems that for all of them they have a success rate between 48% and 57%. I would say that
there does not seem to be a correlation between the number of tasks and the number of solutions.
The results can be seen in results2.txt
